>## Sentence structure
|[Adjunct(s)]|Subject|[tense]|Verb|[Object+prepositions for various indirect objects]
|-|-|-|-|-

All words that are not pronouns or prepositions can act both like nouns and verbs, since they have to be put following the scheme.
***Examples:***
**eu krau**
*I/we (am/are) speak(ing).*
> **NOTE:** Some verbs, like ***krau*** *(to talk/speak/tell/speech)* have certain "forced arguments", i.e.: if the verb is alone, if it is for example *krau*, it means the act of speaking in general, or speech anyhow. The word that comes before is the subject, of course, while the word that comes after is necessarily the addressee the act of speaking/talking/telling is directed to, and the word that comes after the addressee is always the topic of the speaking. The adjuncts are exempted from this structure and always keep their meaning. Read the example below:

**traa krau eu ra'o**

*You (are) tell(ing) me about that matter/them.*
